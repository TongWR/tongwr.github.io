> I'm glad we have you here. Your first task is to build a team of 10 people within the end of this month.

That's how my former boss greeted me at my first job straight out of college.

And off he went.

You see our company was (and still is) a high growth tech startup. My direct supervisor was setting up our new business unit in seven countries all at once. I was asked to run our team in Thailand.

Day 2, started interviewing people. Sometimes five candidates a day, working closely with HR. The first candidate was for graphic designer position. I hadn't the slightest clue what a graphic designer does. I mean, sort of, but not really. Borrowed graphic designer from a neighboring team to help interview the candidate while I pretended to know what's up. Learning curve was steep, to be sure.

Nevertheless, at the end of the month we got five new people on board. For different positions. Probably interviewed like a hundred candidates over the next six months. [^1]

I've since worked in different organizations and teams, systems if you will. The following is discovery you might find useful.
