I've long viewed accounting to be a useless discipline. That recently changed.

A few months back I was asked if I wanna puchase stocks of a hostel on Nimman road—a hip street in my hometown Chiang Mai—from some of their existing owners. After digging in I learnt what accounting actually is.

Desipte its seeming triviality to those of us whose most recent contact with formal accounting education went way back to high school days, accountants are observers of financial truth.

Without doing accounting, you can dream all day of exponential growth without realizing your cost is exploding even faster.  
Without percepts capable of perceiving, there exists truth you cannot perceive.
