Let’s think about financial freedom.

How much money do you need to have in order to consider yourself financially free?
Take a moment to think.
Got a number?

Good. Turns out that’s a wrong way of thinking about it.

Did you wish for a hundred dollars?
A thousand?
A million?
Or a billion?

What are you going to do with that money?

You didn’t want a hundred dollars; you wanted to bring your date to a fancy restaurant on Valentine’s.
You didn’t want a thousand dollars; you wanted to be the first among your friends to hold that newest phone.
You didn’t want a million dollars; you wanted to buy a home when starting your family.
You didn’t want a billion dollars; you wanted...

You don’t want money.
You want what money will buy.

Then, there’s psychological price of owning.

When you have ten dollars, all you worry about is making sure you don’t accidentally drop it before buying lunch.
When you have ten thousand, you start worrying about inflation, about how your deposit will have less value even though you gain some interest.
When you have ten million, you won’t be satisfied until your stocks and businesses beat S&P 500.

And you call this free?
