> “Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply.” - Stephen R. Covey

I belong to this category of most people. That’s why I decided to embark on a journey to [*Listen Better*](https://medium.com/@joshelman/listen-better-505ec72a9f9c).

I’ve found that focusing my effort on improving few important things yields far better results than working on everything at once. Therefore, I’ve promised myself to work on a single theme every year.

This piece is the first attempt in documenting my lifelong learning journey.

I hope you find some of it useful.


# Listen to Strangers

> “Personally I am very fond of strawberries and cream, but I have found that for some strange reason, fish prefer worms. So when I went fishing, I didn’t think about what I wanted. I thought about what they wanted. I didn’t bait the hook with strawberries and cream. Rather, I dangled a worm or a grasshopper in front of the fish and said: ‘Wouldn’t you like to have that?’” – *How to Win Friends & Influence People*, Dale Carnegie

I meet a lot people in my life, we all do. And – usually, upon the first encounter – I put each of these strangers into one of the baskets: allies, enemies, and don’t cares.

Most belong to “don’t cares.”

Time and attention are precious. Why should you waste them on things that don’t matter? The cashier at convenience store near your place doesn’t really have anything to offer, right?

Oh, boys, I couldn’t have been more wrong!

Even from the most transactional point of view, actually listening to random people in these not-so-meaningful interactions makes it easy to get what you want. The cashier is unusually slow today? Complaining won’t make it faster, but asking them how their day is can make them feel better resulting in them being enthusiastic in serving you.

The real return goes far beyond that though. When you start listening to and caring about others who might not be able to do anything for you, you will feel better about yourself. Try it!


# Listen to Colleagues

For the past two years, I’ve been leading flipped, the EdTech (education technology) startup I cofounded, as its CEO. A daunting task to many, creating values for people and acquiring personal wealth from thin air. Prior to that, I had spearheaded Garena’s effort in setting up its newly created mobile business unit in Thailand. That involved growing the team from just me to over a dozen in a couple of months interviewing hundred people along the way. Before that I had been involved in all sorts of student leadership work in university and high school. You could say I’ve had my fair share of serving and leading, working with countless inspiring and aspiring people.

I’ve heard what my colleagues said. But rarely have I listened.

> “A manager’s output = the output of his organization + the output of the neighboring organizations under his influence.” – High Output Management, Andrew S. Grove

Andy was a former chairman and CEO of Intel. In one equation, he makes clear what how a manager should measure the impact of their work. He emphasizes the important of managerial leverage: managers should focus on tasks that result in highest return for their teams. He talks about how 90 minutes of one-on-one meeting with your subordinate can help them be productive for the next two weeks.

We adopted one-on-one at flipped, and I learned a great deal about problems I’d never been aware my co-founders and team had had. Even though we’re a team of just a few! My colleagues felt listened to, they felt respected. Their reliefs after one-on-one were visible. Our office’s vibe significantly improved.

By simply listening, I’ve made not only myself, but also our whole team better off.


# Listen to Loved Ones

“You never treat anyone as equal,” uttered a fine lady whom I’d briefly dated, after a long time of not seeing each other’s face.

I was devastated.

If someone I loved and respected thought of me that way, I’m doomed in all aspects of life. At that moment I reckoned that the random strangers on street would have thought of me much worse, if at all. That’s not what I wanted, for myself or anyone. Where did it go wrong?

Again, the problem is I didn’t listen, let alone understand.

In *The 5 Love Languages Singles Edition*, Gary Chapman teaches how to listen to and speak different love languages: words of affirmation, gifts, acts of service, quality time, and physical touch. He believes our romantic relationships are highly influenced by our relationships with our parents. So in order to improve your romantic relationships, first start by improving the relationships with your parents. Also, everyone has primary love language(s). When you misunderstand your loved ones, it’s because you don’t understand – or aren’t fluent in – the love languages they often speak.

I’m still working on this. But when you know what to listen for it no longer seems that difficult.


# Listen to Yourself

I’ve been meditating every day for over a year now. It’s not hard, you too can do it. Here is how to get some [*Headspace*](https://www.headspace.com/). This app offers easy-to-follow guided meditation. You can choose 10, 15, or 20 minutes per day.

During that silent minutes you get to listen to yourself, observe what comes to your mind when you try not to think, and organize thoughts. It’s breathtaking (literally). I guarantee you that after constantly meditating you’ll be able to think more clearly.

Another great way of listening to yourself is writing to-do list every morning. Allocate time, say 10 minutes, to do this first thing after you wake up. Write down your tasks, draw a box in front of each, and tick the box when you get it done. This allows distracted you during the day, to be reminded of what your productive self wants to accomplish just a few hours earlier.

Clear thinking is rare in the distracted world of today.


# Listen

By this point you should have seen a recurring pattern. It’s easier to get what you want when you ‘listen’ to the needs of others.

There you have it, the secret weapon to happier and more successful life.

Listen well!
