    <h1>Cataloging thoughts in order to improve</h1>
    <p>I've spent the past few years of my life on investing. The 'asset' with highest return on investment, believe it or not, is yourself. Investing in yourself usually involves either physical and mental exercises: reading books, jogging, eating healthy, or blogging. These great habits lasted for a while, but didn't last long.</p>
    <p>What I find interesting is once in a while desires to improve resurface and I discover you've tried it before! And previous attempts had been much more successful than where I was restarting at. Sometimes I've  written about it down in my diary or recorded my achievement through my old health wearable. The problem is these things disappear. It makes me forget the lessons I've learned.</p>
    <p>That's why I'm launching this blog. To make permanent records of my thoughts available to the world. The hope is that those, my future self included, who find any of the ideas interesting can learn, share, critique, or even improve upon them.</p>
